# Recognition of handwritten characters. 
The concept of deep learning began several decated ago as a way of mimicking how the human brain works. Neurons are connected and given weights. Different wights are processed differently through the neural netowrks (NN). NNs have achieved certain human capabilities like object recognition with even higher accuracies.
This project classified handwritten digits as a numbr from 0 - 9 using Tensorflow(open-source deep learning library by Google Brain labs). Model was tested with an unseen image and was correctly predicted by the model. Images unrolled/flattened into one vector (784 units) as a representation of our input image.
